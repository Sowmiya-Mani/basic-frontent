    <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
    <P>A Restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishmentsStories like yours are what helps travellers have better trips. Share your experience and help out a fellow traveller!At HOTEL SPICY, we’re serving up more than other normal Restaurants. In fact, HOTEL SPICY Famous for CHICKEN BRIYANI & BARBIEQUE CHICKENS  is one of our unexpected specialties. Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers high. Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with signature herb-garlic butter, then carved tableside.</P>
